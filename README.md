# Project:
In today's fast-paced business environment, effective task management is pivotal to organizational success. The efficient allocation and monitoring of tasks within a workforce can significantly impact productivity and results. To streamline this process and enhance the overall management of employee tasks, we present the "Employee Task Management System."
The Employee Task Management System is a robust web-based application designed to facilitate the task management process within an organization. This system offers a seamless user experience, enabling both employees and administrators to interact with and manage tasks efficiently. Built on powerful server-side technologies, including Java, JSP, and JDBC, and making use of MySQL as the backend database, this project leverages state-of-the-art tools such as Tomcat 9 and Eclipse for development.
